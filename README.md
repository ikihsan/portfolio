## CI: Build iOS app with Codemagic

This repository includes `codemagic.yaml` to build the iOS app (Capacitor wrapper) in the cloud and deliver a TestFlight build.

Quick start
- Ensure changes are pushed to GitHub (already configured).
- In Codemagic, add the app from your GitHub repo and choose ‚ÄúUse codemagic.yaml‚Äù.
- Add an environment group named `app_store_connect` with:
   - APP_STORE_CONNECT_PRIVATE_KEY (contents of your .p8 ASC API key)
   - APP_STORE_CONNECT_KEY_IDENTIFIER
   - APP_STORE_CONNECT_ISSUER_ID
- Start the workflow: ‚ÄúiOS ‚Ä¢ Capacitor ‚Ä¢ TestFlight‚Äù.

What the pipeline does
1) Uses Node 18, runs `npm ci` and `npm run native:prep` (builds web and syncs iOS)
2) Runs CocoaPods in `native/ios`
3) Builds an .ipa via Xcode using the App scheme and uploads to TestFlight

Artifacts
- The generated .ipa and logs are available in the workflow artifacts. TestFlight upload is automatic when credentials are set.
